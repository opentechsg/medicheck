# MediCheck
Medicheck enables people to save money by finding cheaper, generic alternatives to branded medication.

## Value Proposition
Generic drugs are essentially copies of brand-name drugs. They have the exact same dosage, strength, routes of administration, and risks. Yet, they are often cheaper. A lot of money can potentially be saved from consuming generic drugs.

Taken directly from the [Pharmaceutical Society of Singapore](https://www.pss.org.sg/know-your-medicines/commonly-asked-questions/generic-drug-cost#.Xr6zEcgzaUk):

> Generic medicines are chemically equivalent to patented medicines and are manufactured to the same safety and quality standards. For new generic medicines, the Health Sciences Authority requires the manufacturer to ensure that generics to be marketed are not just chemically equivalent, but also biologically equivalent (or bioequivalent) in the drugâ€™s effect within the human body, usually to an acceptable limit (within +/- 20% for most medicines).  With such a stringent regulation in Singapore, there are no strong reasons to believe that innovators are more efficacious or safer compared to generic medicines.
